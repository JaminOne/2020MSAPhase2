Please consider downloading BOINC or folding@home to use your computers processor to help analyze COVID-19 research.,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fd29vj/please_consider_downloading_boinc_or_foldinghome/,"Hello all.

I believe this has been posted before on this sub, but I wanted to let many of the new members know about distributed computing and the potential it has to help research into COVID19.

Here are some initial comments on how [Rosetta@home](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2020/02/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus/) and [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/) are helping to combat COVID19.

Distributed computing is a fairly simple concept - a university, government research institution, etc takes a large chunk of data and breaks it up into small pieces.  The data is sent out to anyone who is a member of that research team, your computer does the number crunching, and the finished product is sent back to the institution to be added to the whole body of research.  Programs like Rosetta (using the BOINC client) or folding@home can run invisibly in the background, whenever you're not using the computer, or full time (I have three, soon to be four, computers running both clients full time, and a fourth I have running in the background).  The installation takes up a small amount of space, and you can easily control how much of your computer processing power you want dedicated to either program.

To download Folding@Home and join the reddit team:

* Visit this [link.](https://foldingathome.org/start-folding/) to download the FAH client

* Open the FAHControl

* Click ?€?configure?€?

* Select the ?€?Identity?€? tab

* Input **236269** under ?€?team number?€?

To download Rosetta@Home and join the Reddit team: 

* Visit this [link.](https://boinc.berkeley.edu)

* Open the BOINC client

* Select ?€?tools?€? in the menu bar

* Select ?€?add task?€? and choose from the scrolling menu ?€?rosetta?€?.

* Go to [this](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team.php) link, search for /r/covid19 (yes, I did name it after the COVID19 sub) and join the team.  Alternatively, it can also be found [here.]
(https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/team_display.php?teamid=18781)

If anyone has any questions, I would be happy to answer them.

***We have a Twitter now! We will begin to ramp up Twitter operations to get the word out. Let's link up! @DistributedComp***

**EDIT :** We have already hit 100 members in the Rosetta /r/covid19 team.  Thank you so much!  Looking forward to 200!!!

**EDIT 6:** We are currently the 2nd ranked Rosetta team in the world.  We have 663 users.  We will need to multiply our current average daily score by six to reach the #1 spot.  I have no doubt that we will continue to grow our research base.  Please help us by spreading the word as much as you can.  Let's get everyone we know involved with this project.

**EDIT 8:** We just passed 1000 users! (1015 to be exact.)  WOW!

**EDIT 9:** We are earning 1,000,000 compute credits per day.  We now have 1192 members, up from 1015 at the last update just 10 hours ago.

**EDIT 10:** I have just spoken to Dr. David Baker, the head of Baker Labs and rosetta at University of Washington.  Him and his team are planning a large scale rollout of SARS-CoV-2 specific work units in short order.  I will inform you all of news as soon as I get it!",3113,3/3/2020 21:56,16
